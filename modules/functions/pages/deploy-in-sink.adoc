= Deploy transform function in sink
:page-tag: cast, transform-function

As of https://www.datastax.com/products/luna-streaming[Luna Streaming] version 2.10.1.6, transform functions can be deployed inside of a sink process. +
Before this update, functions transformed data either after it was written to a topic by a source connector, or before it was read from a topic by a sink connector. +
This required either an intermediate topic, with additional storage, IO, and latency, or a custom connector. +
Now, functions can be deployed at sink creation and apply preprocessing to sink topic writes. +

== Create sink function in {product}

Creating a sink function is similar to creating a sink in the {astra-ui}, but with a few additional steps.

. xref:pulsar-io:connectors/index.adoc[Create a sink] as described in the {product} documentation.

. During sink creation, select the transform function you want to run inside the sink.

. When the sink is up and running, inspect the sink connector's log.
The function is loaded at sink creation:
+
[source,console]

----

. The function then applies preprocessing to outgoing messages, in this case casting an AVRO record to `String` to your selected topic:
+
[source,json]
----
{{"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"}}
----

== Create sink function in pulsar-admin

https://github.com/datastax/pulsar[Luna Streaming 2.10+] is required to deploy custom functions in {pulsar-short}.

Create a sink connector, and include the path to the transform function and configuration at creation:

[source,shell]
----
pulsar-admin sinks create \
--sink-type elastic-sink \
--inputs my-input-topic \
--tenant public \
--namespace default \
--name my-sink \
--transform-function "builtin://transforms" \
--transform-function-config '{"steps": [{"type": "drop-fields", "fields": "password"}, {"type": "merge-key-value"}, {"type": "unwrap-key-value"}'
----
