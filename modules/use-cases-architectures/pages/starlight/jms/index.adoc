:description: Learn how to get started using the Starlight for JMS API and get hands on with a producer and consumer interacting with a topic.

Starlight for JMS is a highly compliant JMS implementation designed to run on a modern streaming platform.
This guide will get you up and running with a simple Java JMS client that can talk to an {pulsar-reg} streaming instance.

== Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following:

* A working {pulsar-short} cluster.
* Access to the cluster's admin port 8080 and the binary port 6650.

This guide uses {product} to get started with Starlight for JMS.
For more information, see the xref:starlight-for-jms:ROOT:index.adoc[Starlight for JMS documentation].

If you don't have a tenant in {product}, follow our "xref:astra-streaming:getting-started:index.adoc[]" guide.

Luna Streaming::

Follow the "xref:luna-streaming:install-upgrade:quickstart-helm-installs.adoc[]" guide to get a cluster going.

Using a standalone cluster? The Starlight for JMS docs provide the "xref:starlight-for-jms:jms-migration:pulsar-jms-quickstart-sa.adoc[]" guide.

== Messaging with Starlight for JMS

=== Retrieve connection properties in {product}

. In the {product} portal "Connect" tab, the "{pulsar-short}" area provides important connection information.

. Scroll down to the "Tenant Details" area to find your {pulsar-short} connection information.

=== Produce and consume a message

This example uses Maven for the project structure.
If you prefer Gradle or another tool, this code should still be a good fit.

TIP: Visit our https://github.com/datastax/astra-streaming-examples[examples repo] to see the complete source of this example.

. Create a new Maven project.
+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-jms/create-project.sh[]
----

. Open the new project in your favorite IDE or text editor and add the jms dependency to "pom.xml".
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>pulsar-jms-all</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

. Open the file "src/main/java/org/example/App.java" and replace the entire contents with the below code. Notice there are class variables that need replacing. Apply the values previously retrieved in {product}.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-jms/StarlightForJMSClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=init-app]
----
+
NOTE: Don't worry if your editor shows errors, this isn't a complete program... yet.

. Add the following code to build the configuration that will be used by both the producer and consumer.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-jms/StarlightForJMSClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=build-config]
----

. Add the following code into the file.
This is a very simple 'PulsarConnectionFactory' that first creates a JMS queue using the full {pulsar-short} topic address, then creates a message listener callback function that watches the queue.
Finally, it produces a single message on the queue.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-jms/StarlightForJMSClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=build-factory]
----

. You now have a complete program, so let's see it in action! Build and run the jar with the following terminal commands.
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package assembly:single
java -jar target/StarlightForJMSClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----

. If all goes as it should, your output will be similar to this:
+
[source,shell]
----
Sending: Hello there!
Received: Hello there!
----

See how easy that was? You're already an app modernization ninja! +
Keep building those skills with the guides in the next section.
