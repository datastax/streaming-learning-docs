:description: Learn how to get started using the Starlight for RabbitMQ extension with Pulsar and get hands on by publishing and consuming messages from a topic.
:title: Getting started with the Starlight for RabbitMQ extension
:navtitle: Starlight for RabbitMQ

Starlight for RabbitMQ acts as a proxy between your https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ^]{external-link-icon} application and https://pulsar.apache.org/[Apache Pulsarâ„¢^]{external-link-icon} cluster.
It implements the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol used by RabbitMQ clients and translates AMQP frames and concepts to Pulsar concepts.

If source code is your thing, visit the https://github.com/datastax/starlight-for-rabbitmq[project's repo on GitHub^]{external-link-icon}.

== Architecture reference

If you want to dive deep into how Starlight for RabbitMQ works, xref:starlight-for-rabbitmq:ROOT:index.adoc[read the documentation].

== Establishing the RabbitMQ protocol handler

Before you can use a RabbitMQ client to interact with your Pulsar cluster, you need the Starlight for RabbitMQ protocol handler installed in the cluster.
Installation looks a bit different depending on where your Pulsar cluster is running.
Choose the option that best fits your needs.

Astra Streaming::

--
If you want a working RabbitMQ extension as quickly as possible, this is your best bet. This is also a good option for those that already have a streaming tenant and are looking to extend it.

. Sign in to your Astra account and navigate to your streaming tenant.
+
TIP: Don't have a streaming tenant? Follow our "xref:astra-streaming:getting-started:index.adoc[]" guide.

. Go to the "Connect" tab and choose the "RabbitMQ" option.
+
image:astra-streaming-connect-rabbitmq.png[Astra Streaming connect RabbitMQ]

. You will see an "Enable RabbitMQ" button. Click to continue.
+
image:enable-rabbitmq-button.png[Astra Streaming enable RabbitMQ]

. A message will let you know of the additions (and restrictions) that come with using Starlight for RabbitMQ.
image:enable-rabbitmq-message.png[Astra Streaming enable RabbitMQ message]

. Click the "Enable RabbitMQ" button to confirm your understanding.

Your Astra Streaming tenant is ready for prime time! Continue to the next section of the guide to see it in action.
--
Luna Streaming::
+
--
The Starlight for RabbitMQ extension is included in the `luna-streaming-all` image used to deploy a Luna cluster. The Luna helm chart makes deploying the Kafka extension quite easy. Follow the "xref:luna-streaming:components:starlight-for-rabbitmq.adoc[]" guide to create a simple Pulsar cluster with the Starlight for RabbitMQ extension ready for use.
--
Self Managed::
+
--
Already have your own Pulsar Cluster? Or maybe you're using a standalone cluster? Starlight for RabbitMQ can easily be a part of that cluster! Follow the "xref:starlight-for-rabbitmq:installation:getting-started.adoc[]" guide.

== Messaging with Starlight for RabbitMQ

Starlight for RabbitMQ supports quite a few different use cases.
With a Pulsar cluster between publishers and consumers you can interchange the type of publisher and consumer to fit your needs.

*The below examples are using an Astra Streaming tenant as the AMQP listener.* If you are using Luna Streaming or a self-managed tenant, switch the listener URL for your own.

=== Retrieve RabbitMQ connection properties in Astra Streaming

In the Astra Streaming portal "Connect" tab, the "RabbitMQ" area provides important connection information.
You will need this connection information to create a working RabbitMQ client or use the CLI.

TIP: Click the clipboard icon to copy the RabbitMQ connection values, as well as a working token to paste in code.

=== Produce and consume a message

RabbitMQ Client (Java)::
+
--
This example uses Maven for the project structure.
If you prefer Gradle or another tool, this code should still be a good fit.

TIP: Visit our https://github.com/datastax/astra-streaming-examples[examples repo^]{external-link-icon} to see the complete source for this example.

. Create a new Maven project.
+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/create-project.sh[]
----

. Open the new project in your favorite IDE or text editor and add the RabbitMQ client dependency to "pom.xml".
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.rabbitmq</groupId>
  <artifactId>amqp-client</artifactId>
  <version>5.16.0</version>
</dependency>
----

. Open the file "src/main/java/org/example/App.java" and replace the entire contents with the below code.
Notice there are class variables that need replacing.
Apply the values previously retrieved in Astra Streaming.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=init-app]
----
+
NOTE: Don't worry if your editor shows errors, this isn't a complete program... yet.

. Add the following code to create a valid connection, a channel, and a queue that will be used by both the producer and consumer.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=create-queue]
----

. Add the producer code to the file.
This is a very simple flow that sends a single message and awaits acknowledgment.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=build-producer]
----

. Add the consumer code to the file.
This creates a basic consumer with callback on message receipt.
Because the consumer isn't a blocking thread, we'll sleep for a few seconds and let things process.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=build-consumer]
----

. You now have a complete program, so let's see it in action!
Build and run the jar with the following terminal commands.
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package assembly:single
java -jar target/StarlightForRabbitMqClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----

. If all goes as it should, your output will be similar to this:
+
[source,shell]
----
Sent 'Hello World!'
Received 'Hello World!'
----

Congrats! You used the RabbitMQ client to send and receive messages in Pulsar.
