= Getting started with the {starlight-rabbitmq} extension
:navtitle: {starlight-rabbitmq}
:description: Learn how to get started using the {starlight-rabbitmq} extension with {pulsar-short} and get hands on by publishing and consuming messages from a topic.

{starlight-rabbitmq} acts as a proxy between your https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] application and https://pulsar.apache.org/[{pulsar-reg}] cluster.
It implements the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol used by RabbitMQ clients and translates AMQP frames and concepts to {pulsar-short} concepts.

If source code is your thing, visit the https://github.com/datastax/starlight-for-rabbitmq[project's repo on GitHub].

== Architecture reference

If you want to dive deep into how {starlight-rabbitmq} works, xref:starlight-for-rabbitmq:ROOT:index.adoc[read the documentation].

== Establishing the RabbitMQ protocol handler

Before you can use a RabbitMQ client to interact with your {pulsar-short} cluster, you need the {starlight-rabbitmq} protocol handler installed in the cluster.
Installation looks a bit different depending on where your {pulsar-short} cluster is running.
Choose the option that best fits your needs.

{product}::
+
--
If you want a working RabbitMQ extension as quickly as possible, this is your best bet. This is also a good option for those that already have a streaming tenant and are looking to extend it.

. Sign in to your {product-short} account and navigate to your streaming tenant.
+
TIP: Don't have a streaming tenant? Follow our "xref:astra-streaming:getting-started:index.adoc[]" guide.

. Go to the "Connect" tab and choose the "RabbitMQ" option.
+
image:astra-streaming-connect-rabbitmq.png[{product} connect RabbitMQ]

. You will see an "Enable RabbitMQ" button. Click to continue.
+
image:enable-rabbitmq-button.png[{product} enable RabbitMQ]

. A message will let you know of the additions (and restrictions) that come with using {starlight-rabbitmq}.
+
image:enable-rabbitmq-message.png[{product} enable RabbitMQ message]

. Click the "Enable RabbitMQ" button to confirm your understanding.

Your {product} tenant is ready for prime time! Continue to the next section of the guide to see it in action.

Luna Streaming::
+
--
The {starlight-rabbitmq} extension is included in the `luna-streaming-all` image used to deploy a Luna cluster. The Luna helm chart makes deploying the Kafka extension quite easy. Follow the "xref:luna-streaming:components:starlight-for-rabbitmq.adoc[]" guide to create a simple {pulsar-short} cluster with the {starlight-rabbitmq} extension ready for use.
--
Self Managed::
+
--
Already have your own {pulsar-short} Cluster? Or maybe you're using a standalone cluster? {starlight-rabbitmq} can easily be a part of that cluster! Follow the "xref:starlight-for-rabbitmq:installation:getting-started.adoc[]" guide.

== Messaging with {starlight-rabbitmq}

{starlight-rabbitmq} supports quite a few different use cases.
With a {pulsar-short} cluster between publishers and consumers you can interchange the type of publisher and consumer to fit your needs.

*The below examples are using an {product} tenant as the AMQP listener.* If you are using Luna Streaming or a self-managed tenant, switch the listener URL for your own.

=== Retrieve RabbitMQ connection properties in {product}

In the {product} portal "Connect" tab, the "RabbitMQ" area provides important connection information.
You will need this connection information to create a working RabbitMQ client or use the CLI.

TIP: Click the clipboard icon to copy the RabbitMQ connection values, as well as a working token to paste in code.

=== Produce and consume a message

RabbitMQ Client (Java)::
+
--
This example uses Maven for the project structure.
If you prefer Gradle or another tool, this code should still be a good fit.

TIP: Visit our https://github.com/datastax/astra-streaming-examples[examples repo] to see the complete source for this example.

. Create a new Maven project.
+
[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/create-project.sh[]
----

. Open the new project in your favorite IDE or text editor and add the RabbitMQ client dependency to "pom.xml".
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.rabbitmq</groupId>
  <artifactId>amqp-client</artifactId>
  <version>5.16.0</version>
</dependency>
----

. Open the file "src/main/java/org/example/App.java" and replace the entire contents with the below code.
Notice there are class variables that need replacing.
Apply the values previously retrieved in {product}.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=init-app]
----
+
NOTE: Don't worry if your editor shows errors, this isn't a complete program... yet.

. Add the following code to create a valid connection, a channel, and a queue that will be used by both the producer and consumer.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=create-queue]
----

. Add the producer code to the file.
This is a very simple flow that sends a single message and awaits acknowledgment.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=build-producer]
----

. Add the consumer code to the file.
This creates a basic consumer with callback on message receipt.
Because the consumer isn't a blocking thread, we'll sleep for a few seconds and let things process.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/java/starlight-for-rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client/StarlightForRabbitMqClient/src/main/java/org/example/App.java[tag=build-consumer]
----

. You now have a complete program, so let's see it in action!
Build and run the jar with the following terminal commands.
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package assembly:single
java -jar target/StarlightForRabbitMqClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----

. If all goes as it should, your output will be similar to this:
+
[source,shell]
----
Sent 'Hello World!'
Received 'Hello World!'
----

Congrats! You used the RabbitMQ client to send and receive messages in {pulsar-short}.
