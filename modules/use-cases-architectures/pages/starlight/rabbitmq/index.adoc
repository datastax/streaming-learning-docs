= Getting started with the {starlight-rabbitmq} extension
:navtitle: {starlight-rabbitmq}
:description: Learn how to get started using the {starlight-rabbitmq} extension with {pulsar-short} and get hands on by publishing and consuming messages from a topic.

{starlight-rabbitmq} acts as a proxy between your https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] application and https://pulsar.apache.org/[{pulsar-reg}] cluster.
It implements the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol used by RabbitMQ clients and translates AMQP frames and concepts to {pulsar-short} concepts.

If source code is your thing, visit the https://github.com/datastax/starlight-for-rabbitmq[project's repo on GitHub].

== Establishing the RabbitMQ protocol handler

Before you can use a RabbitMQ client to interact with your {pulsar-short} cluster, you need the {starlight-rabbitmq} protocol handler installed in the cluster.
Installation looks a bit different depending on where your {pulsar-short} cluster is running.
Choose the option that best fits your needs.

--
If you want a working RabbitMQ extension as quickly as possible, this is your best bet. This is also a good option for those that already have a streaming tenant and are looking to extend it.

. Sign in to your Astra account and navigate to your streaming tenant.
+
TIP: Don't have a streaming tenant? Follow our "xref:astra-streaming:getting-started:index.adoc[]" guide.

. Go to the "Connect" tab and choose the "RabbitMQ" option.

. Click "Enable RabbitMQ".

. A message will let you know of the additions (and restrictions) that come with using {starlight-rabbitmq}.

. Click the "Enable RabbitMQ" button to confirm your understanding.

Your Astra Streaming tenant is ready for prime time! Continue to the next section of the guide to see it in action.
--
Luna Streaming::
+
--
The {starlight-rabbitmq} extension is included in the `luna-streaming-all` image used to deploy a Luna cluster. The Luna helm chart makes deploying the Kafka extension quite easy. Follow the "xref:luna-streaming:components:starlight-for-rabbitmq.adoc[]" guide to create a simple {pulsar-short} cluster with the {starlight-rabbitmq} extension ready for use.

== Use Starlight for RabbitMQ with Luna Streaming

Starlight for RabbitMQ brings native https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] protocol support to https://pulsar.apache.org/[{pulsar-reg}] by introducing a RabbitMQ protocol handler on {pulsar-short} brokers or {pulsar-short} proxies.
By adding the Starlight for RabbitMQ protocol handler to your {pulsar-short} cluster, you can migrate your existing RabbitMQ applications and services to {pulsar-short} without modifying the code.

The following steps explain how to deploy a Luna Streaming Helm chart with the Starlight for RabbitMQ protocol handler extension.

=== Prerequisites

* https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm 3 CLI] (we used version 3.8.0)
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Kubectl CLI] (we used version 1.23.4)
* Python (we used version 3.8.10)
* Enough access to a K8s cluster to create a namespace, deployments, and pods

=== Install Luna Streaming Helm chart

. Add the {company} Helm chart repo to your Helm store.
+
[source,shell]
----
helm repo add datastax-pulsar https://datastax.github.io/pulsar-helm-chart
----

. Install the Helm chart using a minimalist values file.
This command creates a Helm release named `my-pulsar-cluster` using the {company} Luna Helm chart, within the K8s namespace `datastax-pulsar`.
The minimal cluster creates only the essential components and has no ingress or load balanced services.
+
[source,shell]
----
VALUES_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datastaxdevs/luna-streaming-examples/main/starlight-for-rabbitmq/values.yaml"
helm install \
  --namespace datastax-pulsar \
  --create-namespace \
  --values $VALUES_URL \
  --version 3.0.4 \
  my-pulsar-cluster \
  datastax-pulsar/pulsar
----

. Wait for the broker pod to be in a running state. You might see a few restarts as your components start up.
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n datastax-pulsar wait --for=condition=Ready pod/pulsar-broker-0 --timeout=120s
----

=== Forward service port

You'll need to interact with a few of the services in the K8s cluster.
Map a few ports to those services.

In a new terminal, port forward {pulsar-short}'s admin service:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl port-forward -n datastax-pulsar service/pulsar-broker 8080:8080
----

In a separate terminal window, port forward the Starlight for RabbitMQ service:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl port-forward -n datastax-pulsar service/pulsar-proxy 5672:5672
----

=== Produce a message with the RabbitMQ Python client

If you hadn't noticed, we never opened the {pulsar-short} binary port to accept new messages.
Only the admin port and the RabbitMQ port are open.
To further demonstrate how native Starlight for RabbitMQ is, we will use the Pika RabbitMQ Python library to produce and consume messages from {pulsar-short}.

Save the following Python script to a safe place as `test-queue.py`.
The script assumes you have opened the localhost:5672 port.

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(port=5672))
channel = connection.channel()

try:
    channel.queue_declare("test-queue")
    print("created test-queue queue")

    channel.basic_publish(exchange="", routing_key="test-queue", body="test".encode('utf-8'))
    print("published message test")

    _, _, res = channel.basic_get(queue="test-queue", auto_ack=True)
    assert res is not None, "should have received a message"
    print("received message: " + res.decode())

    channel.queue_delete("test-queue")
    print("deleted test-queue queue")

finally:
    connection.close()
----

Open a terminal and return to the safe place where you saved the Python script.
Run the following command to execute the Python program.

[source,shell]
----
python ./test-queue.py
----

The output should look like the following.

[source,shell]
----
created test-queue queue
published message test
received message: test
deleted test-queue queue
----

=== Next steps

The Luna Helm chart deployed Starlight for RabbitMQ on the {pulsar-short} proxy and opened the correct port.
Your application will now "talk" to {pulsar-short} as if it were a real RabbitMQ host.

Self Managed::
+
--
Already have your own {pulsar-short} Cluster? Or maybe you're using a standalone cluster? {starlight-rabbitmq} can easily be a part of that cluster! Follow the "xref:starlight-for-rabbitmq:installation:getting-started.adoc[]" guide.

====

== Messaging with {starlight-rabbitmq}

{starlight-rabbitmq} supports quite a few different use cases.
With a {pulsar-short} cluster between publishers and consumers you can interchange the type of publisher and consumer to fit your needs.

*The below examples are using an Astra Streaming tenant as the AMQP listener.* If you are using Luna Streaming or a self-managed tenant, switch the listener URL for your own.

=== Retrieve RabbitMQ connection properties in Astra Streaming

In the Astra Streaming portal "Connect" tab, the "RabbitMQ" area provides important connection information.
You will need this connection information to create a working RabbitMQ client or use the CLI.

image:rabbitmq-client-settings.png[Astra Streaming RabbitMQ settings]

TIP: Click the clipboard icon to copy the RabbitMQ connection values, as well as a working token to paste in code.

=== Produce and consume a message

This example uses Maven for the project structure for a Rabbit MQ Java client.
If you prefer Gradle or another tool, this code should still be a good fit.

For complete source code examples, see the https://github.com/datastax/astra-streaming-examples[Astra Streaming examples repository].

. Create a new Maven project.
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=org.example \
    -DartifactId=StarlightForRabbitMqClient \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
    -DinteractiveMode=false

cd StarlightForRabbitMqClient
----

. Open the new project in your IDE or text editor, and then add the RabbitMQ client dependency to `pom.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.rabbitmq</groupId>
  <artifactId>amqp-client</artifactId>
  <version>5.16.0</version>
</dependency>
----

. Open the file `src/main/java/org/example/App.java`, and then enter the following code.
If you cloned the example repo, replace the entire contents with the following code.
Your editor will report errors because this isn't a complete program yet.
+
Replace placeholders with the values you previously retrieved from Astra Streaming.
+
[source,java]
----
package org.example;

import com.rabbitmq.client.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.KeyManagementException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;

public class App {
  private static final String username = "";
  private static final String password = "<REPLACE_WITH_PULSAR_TOKEN>";
  private static final String host = "<REPLACE_WITH_SERVICE_URL>";
  private static final int port = 5671;
  private static final String virtual_host = "<REPLACE_WITH_TENANT_NAME>/<REPLACE_WITH_NAMESPACE>"; //The "rabbitmq" namespace should have been created when you enabled S4R
  private static final String queueName = "<REPLACE_WITH_TOPIC_NAME>"; //This will get created automatically
  private static final String amqp_URI = String.format("amqps://%s:%s@%s:%d/%s", username, password, host, port, virtual_host.replace("/","%2f"));

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, TimeoutException, URISyntaxException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, KeyManagementException, InterruptedException {
----

. Add the code to create a connection, channel, and queue that will be used by both the producer and consumer:
+
[source,java]
----
    ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
    factory.setUri(amqp_URI);

    /*
    You could also set each value individually
      factory.setHost(host);
      factory.setPort(port);
      factory.setUsername(username);
      factory.setPassword(password);
      factory.setVirtualHost(virtual_host);
      factory.useSslProtocol();
     */

    Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
    Channel channel = connection.createChannel();

    channel.queueDeclare(queueName, false, false, false, null);
----

. Add the producer code, which is a simple flow that sends a single message and awaits acknowledgment:
+
[source,java]
----
    String publishMessage = "Hello World!";
    channel.basicPublish("", queueName, null, publishMessage.getBytes());
    System.out.println(" Sent '" + publishMessage + "'");
----

. Add the consumer code, which creates a basic consumer with callback on message receipt.
Because the consumer isn't a blocking thread, the `sleep` allows time for messages to be received and processed.
+
[source,java]
----
    DeliverCallback deliverCallback = (consumerTag, delivery) -> {
      String consumeMessage = new String(delivery.getBody(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
      System.out.println(" Received '" + consumeMessage + "'");
    };

    channel.basicConsume(queueName, true, deliverCallback, consumerTag -> { });

    Thread.sleep(4000); // wait a bit for messages to be received

    channel.close();
    connection.close();
  }
}
----

. Build and run the JAR file for the complete program:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package assembly:single
java -jar target/StarlightForRabbitMqClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----
+
.Result
[%collapsible]
====
[source,shell]
----
Sent 'Hello World!'
Received 'Hello World!'
----
