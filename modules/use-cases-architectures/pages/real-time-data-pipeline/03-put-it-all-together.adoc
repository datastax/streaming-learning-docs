1.0, February 1, 2022: Putting the real-time data pipeline together

This guide is part of a series that creates a real-time data pipeline with Astra and Decodable. For context and prerequisites, start xref:streaming-learning:use-cases-architectures:real-time-data-pipeline/index.adoc[here].

Now we have all the pieces of our data processing pipeline in place. It’s time to start the connection and pipelines up and input some test data.

== Starting the processing

. Navigate to the “Connections” area and click the 3 dots at the right for each connection. Click the “Start” option on all 3 connections.

. It might take a minute or so but each connection should refresh with a state of “Running”.
+

+
TIP: If one of the connections has an issue startup up (like a wrong setting or expired token) you can click on that connection to get more information.

. Navigate to the “Pipelines” area and use the same menu on each pipeline to start. Same as the connections, they might take a minute or so to get going. Grab a coffee while you wait - you’ve earned it.

Let’s make sure we have all the pieces in order…

* REST connection running: CHECK
* Astra Streaming connections running : CHECK
* Normalization pipeline running: CHECK
* Product clicks filter pipeline running: CHECK

== Your first ingested data

. Navigate to the “Connections” area and click the “REST” connector.

. Choose the “Upload” tab and copy/paste the following web click data into the window.
+
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "click_epoch": 1655303592179,
    "request_url": "https://somedomain.com/catalog/area1/yetanother-cool-product?a=b&c=d",
    "visitor_id": "b56afbf3-321f-49c1-919c-b2ea3e550b07",
    "UTC_offset": -4,
    "browser_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/102.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
  }
]
----

. Click “Upload” to simulate data being posted to the endpoint. You should receive a confirmation that data has been received.

NOTE: NO, this was not a big moment with cheers and balloons. The celebration is at the end of the next area.

== Following the flow

For this first record of data, let’s look at each step along the way and confirm processing is working.

. After the data was ingested, the “Webstore-Raw-Clicks-Normalize-Pipeline” should have received it. You can confirm this by navigating the “Pipelines” area and clicking that pipeline to see its metrics. Notice in the “Input Metrics” area 1 record has been received.
+

. Also notice in the “Output Metrics” 1 record has been written. This confirms that the data passed successfully through this pipeline.

. Next we can go to the “Connectors” area and click the “Astra-Streaming-All-Webclicks-Connector”. In the “Input Metrics” we see that 1 record has been received.
+
image:decodable-data-pipeline/03/image4.png[]

. Now we can go to our Astra Streaming tenant “webstore-clicks” and navigate to the “Namespace and Topics” area. Expand the “Production” namespace and click the “all-clicks” topic. Notice that “Data In” has 1 message and “Data Out” has 1 message. That means the topic took the data in and a consumer acknowledged receipt of the message.
+
image:decodable-data-pipeline/03/image6.png[]

. On to the “Sinks” tab in Astra and click the “all-clicks” sink. In “Instance Stats” you see “Reads” has a value of 1 and “Writes” has a value of 1. This confirms the Sink consumed a message from the topic and wrote the data to the store.
+
image:decodable-data-pipeline/03/image5.png[]

. Let’s look at the final data in Astra DB. Navigate to the Astra home and click the “webstore-clicks” Serverless Database. Choose the “CQL Console” tab and copy/paste the following command in the terminal.
+
[source,sql]
----
select * from click_data.all_clicks;
----
+
Your should see a single record output.

{emoji-tada}{emoji-tada} Queue the loud cheers and high-fives! Our pipeline ingested raw web click data, normalized it, and persisted the parsed data to the database! Woot woot!!

== Follow the flow of the product clicks data

Similar to how you followed the above flow follow this flow to confirm the filtered messages were stored.

. Navigate to your Decodable pipeline named “Webstore-Product-Clicks-Pipeline”.
.. The “Input Metrics” should be 1 record and the “Output Metrics” should be 1 record.

. Navigate to your Decodable connection named “Astra-Streaming-Product-Webclicks-Connection”.
.. The “Input Metrics” should be 1 record.

. Head over to your Astra tenant to the production/product-clicks topic.
.. There should be 1 message in “Data In” and 1 message in “Data Out”.

. Finally, to your Astra database CQL Console.
.. Query the product clicks table
+
[source,sql]
----
select * from click_data.product_clicks;
----

{emoji-rocket}{emoji-rocket} Yesssss! The first web click data we entered happened to be a product click. So the data was filtered in the pipeline and processed into the correct table!

== Example real-time site data

Let’s see what this can do! To put a load on the pipeline we’ll need a way to continuously post data to our endpoint. Below are a few examples. Use the download button below to download a zip of a static(html) site ecommerce catalog, that silently posts click data to an endpoint. The site is a copy of https://www.blazemeter.com/[BlazeMeter^]’s{external-link-icon} https://www.demoblaze.com/[Demoblaze site^]{external-link-icon}.

You’ll need 2 pieces of information the Endpoint URL and an authorization token. Learn more about retrieving both of those in https://docs.decodable.co/docs/connector-reference-rest#authentication[Decodable documentation^]{external-link-icon}.

Once you extract the zip, open the folder in your text editor of IDE of choice and look in the script.js file. There are 2 placeholders for the data retrieved above.

Open the phones.html file in your browser (yes, as a local file) and begin clicking on products. Each click should be a new post to your Decodable endpoint.
