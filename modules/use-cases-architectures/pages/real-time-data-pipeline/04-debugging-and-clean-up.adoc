= Debugging and cleaning up the real-time data pipeline
:navtitle: 4. Debugging and cleanup

[NOTE]
====
This guide is part of a series that creates a real-time data pipeline with {product} and Decodable. For context and prerequisites, start xref:streaming-learning:use-cases-architectures:real-time-data-pipeline/index.adoc[here].

== Debugging the pipeline

If your pipeline didn't work as expected, there are a few things you can do to debug the issue.

First, find where the pipeline broke by following the data flows described in xref:real-time-data-pipeline/03-put-it-all-together.adoc#following-the-flow[Follow the flow of the product data clicks].

With Decodable, you can click through the connections, streams, and pipelines and visualize where the connection failed.
For example, if you accidentally named a stream `click-stream` instead of `clicks-stream`, you can follow the click event to the outbound `clicks-stream` and then to the pipeline.
There, you'll see that the pipeline isn't receiving the message because its inbound stream is misnamed `click-stream`.
Then, you can stop the pipeline, fix the inbound stream name, and then restart the pipeline to get data flowing again.

If that doesn't resolve the issue, you can test input data at the point of failure.
In this case, you want to determine if the input data is malformed, or if the object itself is failing.
There are two tools you can use to debug this at various stages of the pipleine:

* In Decodable, you can use the **Preview** feature to see a sample of data processing in each pipeline.
* In {product}, each tenant has a **Try Me** feature where you can simulate producing and consuming messages in specific topics.

== Clean up

To clean up the resources created for this tutorial, you need to remove the Decodable and {product-short} objects you created.

=== Removing Decodable objects

. For each "Connection" click the 3 dots and choose "Stop".
+
image:decodable-data-pipeline/04/image1.png["Stop decodable connection"]

. Once "Stopped", click the 3 dots again and choose "Delete". This will remove the object from your account.
+
image:decodable-data-pipeline/04/image2.png["Delete decodable connection"]

. Repeat this for each "Connection" and "Pipeline". You can also remove the "Streams" if you prefer.

=== Removing {product-short} objects

. In the {astra-ui-link}, click *Streaming tenants*.

. Find the `webstore-clicks` tenant, click icon:ellipsis-vertical[name="More"], and then select **Delete**.
+
This removes the tenant and all associated sinks, topics, messages, and namespaces.

. In the {astra-ui-link} header, click **Serverless databases**.

. Find the `webstore-clicks` database, click icon:ellipsis-vertical[name="More"], and then select **Terminate**.
+
This removes the database and all associated keyspaces and tables.
This can take a few minutes.

== Next step

Now that you've created a sample pipeline, try modifying the tutorial to create a pipeline for your own use cases, like fraud detection or removing personally identifiable information (PII).
