[NOTE]
====
This guide is part of a series that creates a real-time data pipeline with Astra and Decodable. For context and prerequisites, start xref:streaming-learning:use-cases-architectures:real-time-data-pipeline/index.adoc[here].

== Debugging the pipeline

Maybe things didn’t go so smoothly for you. Or maybe you're just having a bad day :(. Whatever the case use the flow above to find where in the pipeline things are broken. Then get a bit deeper into that object. You’ll want to test input data at the point of failure. The first question to answer is if the input data is malformed or if the object itself is erring. Decodable’s UI gives you the ability in each pipeline to “Preview” the processing. This is a very powerful debugging tool. Your Astra Tenant has the “Try Me” area where you can set up producing and consuming messages in specific topics. These tools can help you recreate each step of the pipeline and debug issues.

== Clean up

=== Removing Decodable objects


. For each "Connection" click the 3 dots and choose "Stop".

. Once "Stopped", click the 3 dots again and choose "Delete". This will remove the object from your account.

. Repeat this for each "Connection" and "Pipeline". You can also remove the "Streams" if you prefer.

=== Removing Astra objects

. From the Astra portal home navigate to the "Streaming" area to see a list of your tenants.

. Click the 3 dots associated with "webstore-clicks" tenant and choose the "Delete". This will remove all sinks, topics, messages, and namespaces.
+

. Navigate to the "Databases" area and click the 3 dots associated with "webstore-clicks". Choose "Terminate" to remove all traces of the database (it might take a few seconds).

You have removed all objects and are ready to start fresh! Your next processing pipeline can solve a business challenge like fraud detection or removing personally identifiable information, or maybe how to get to the moon! Have fun!
