== Adding a Kafka Source Connector in Datastax Astra Streaming

To create a Kafka Source Connector, visit the *Sources* tab in {product_name} and choose *Create Source*. 
This step opens the *Create New Source* page with a list of fields required to build your new Kafka Source Connector.

=== Advanced Settings

In your *Advanced Settings*, control the number of instances, auto-acknowledgement, and timeout.
Processing Guarantee offers three options:

* *ATLEAST_ONCE*: Each message sent to the source can be processed more than once.
* *ATMOST_ONCE*: The message sent to the source is processed at most once. Therefore, there is a chance that the message is not processed.
* *EFFECTIVELY_ONCE*: Each message sent to the source will have one output associated with it.

=== Source-Specific Configuration

`Group-ID` is a unique string that identifies the consumer group that this consumer belongs to.

The bootstrap server `host`/`port` pairs must be in this format: `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,...`

The Kafka topic defined in the source-specific configuration will receive messages from Pulsar:
