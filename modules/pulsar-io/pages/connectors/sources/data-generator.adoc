:connectorName: data-gen-src
:connectorType: data-generator
:page-tag: data-generator,source-connector

The Data Generator source connector creates fake data on an {pulsar-reg} topic using the https://github.com/Codearte/jfairy[JFAIRY library] to generate a message containing "person" data.

"Person" data includes first and last name, home address, and email address, among other details.

The connector will produce data indefinitely while it is running.

{product} currently supports {pulsar} {pulsar-version}, which uses version 0.5.9 of the jfairy library.

For a reference of the full "Person" class, https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/branch-{pulsar-version}/pulsar-io/data-generator/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/io/datagenerator/Person.java[view the source].
