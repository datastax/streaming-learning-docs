= Debezium MongoDB Source Connector for {product_name}

Debeziumâ€™s MongoDB connector tracks a MongoDB replica set or a MongoDB sharded cluster for document changes in databases and collections and records those changes as messages in an Apache Pulsar topic. 

The connector automatically handles the addition or removal of shards in a sharded cluster, changes in membership of each replica set, elections within each replica set, and the resolution of communications problems.

Astra Streaming currently supports Apache Pulsar {pulsar_version}, which uses Debezium {debezium_version} libraries. For a list of supported MongoDB versions, please refer to the https://debezium.io/releases/{debezium_version}/[Debezium documentation^].
