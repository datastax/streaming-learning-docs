= Elasticsearch Sink Connector for {product_name}

Elasticsearch is the distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack. 

Use Elasticsearch to store, search, and manage data for logs, metrics, search backend, application monitoring, and endpoint security. 

[NOTE]
====
Astra Streaming currently supports Apache Pulsar {pulsar_version}, which uses the https://opensearch.org/docs/1.2/clients/java-rest-high-level/[OpenSearch 1.2.4 library^] to interact with
Elasticsearch.

[NOTE]
====
To understand compatibility between OpenSearch and Elasticsearch, refer to https://opensearch.org/faq/#q1.8[question 1.8^] in the FAQs.
