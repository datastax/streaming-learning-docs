{product_name} offers fully-managed Apache Pulsarâ„¢ connectors. 

Create, monitor, and manage both source and sink connectors through our simple UI, the `pulsar-admin` CLI, or RESTful API. Connect popular data sources to Apache Pulsar topics or sink data from Pulsar topics to popular systems.

Below is a list of Apache Pulsar source and sink connectors supported by {product_name}.

== Listing Sink Connectors

To list available sink connectors in your {product_name} tenant, use any of the following.

[tabs]

Assuming you have downloaded client.conf to the Pulsar folder:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
./bin/pulsar-admin sinks available-sinks

You'll need to create an Astra Streaming API token to be used with the Rest API. This is different from your Astra tokens. 

Navigate to the "Settings" area in the Astra Streaming UI and choose "Create Token".

Retrieve the web service URL from the "Connect" tab in the Astra Streaming UI.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
export WEB_SERVICE_URL=<replace-me>
export ASTRA_STREAMING_TOKEN=<replace-me>
