|*Required*
|*Default*
|*Description*

| `apiKey` | String| false | " " (empty string)|The apiKey used by the connector to connect to the ElasticSearch cluster. Only one between basic/token/apiKey authentication mode must be configured. 
| `bulkActions` | Integer | false | 1000 | The maximum number of actions per elasticsearch bulk request. Use -1 to disable it. 
| `bulkConcurrentRequests` | Integer | false | 0 | The maximum number of in flight elasticsearch bulk requests. The default 0 allows the execution of a single request. A value of 1 means 1 concurrent request is allowed to be executed while accumulating new bulk requests. 
| `bulkEnabled` | Boolean | false | false | Enable the elasticsearch bulk processor to flush write requests based on the number or size of requests, or after a given period. 
| `bulkFlushIntervalInMs` | Long | false | 1000 | The maximum period of time to wait for flushing pending writes when bulk writes are enabled. -1 or zero means the scheduled flushing is disabled. 
| `bulkSizeInMb` | Integer | false |5 | The maximum size in megabytes of elasticsearch bulk requests. Use -1 to disable it. 
| `canonicalKeyFields` | Boolean | false | false | Whether to sort the key fields for JSON and Avro or not. If it is set to `true` and the record key schema is `JSON` or `AVRO`, the serialized object does not consider the order of properties. 
| `compatibilityMode` | enum (AUTO,ELASTICSEARCH,ELASTICSEARCH_7,OPENSEARCH) | false | AUTO | Specify compatibility mode with the ElasticSearch cluster. `AUTO` value will try to auto detect the correct compatibility mode to use. Use `ELASTICSEARCH_7` if the target cluster is running ElasticSearch 7 or prior. Use `ELASTICSEARCH` if the target cluster is running ElasticSearch 8 or higher. Use `OPENSEARCH` if the target cluster is running OpenSearch. 
| `compressionEnabled` | Boolean | false |false | Enable elasticsearch request compression. 
| `connectionIdleTimeoutInMs` | Integer | false |5 | Idle connection timeout to prevent a read timeout. 
| `connectionRequestTimeoutInMs` | Integer | false |1000 | The time in milliseconds for getting a connection from the elasticsearch connection pool. 
| `connectTimeoutInMs` | Integer | false |5000 | The elasticsearch client connection timeout in milliseconds. 
| `createIndexIfNeeded` | Boolean | false | false | Manage index if missing. 
| `elasticSearchUrl` | String| true | " " (empty string)| The URL of elastic search cluster to which the connector connects. 
| `idHashingAlgorithm` | enum(NONE,SHA256,SHA512)| false | NONE|Hashing algorithm to use for the document id. This is useful in order to be compliant with the ElasticSearch _id hard limit of 512 bytes. 
| `indexName` | String| false |" " (empty string)| The index name to which the connector writes messages. The default value is the topic name. It accepts date formats in the name to support event time based index with the pattern `%{+<date-format>}`. For example, suppose the event time of the record is 1645182000000L, the indexName is `logs-%{+yyyy-MM-dd}`, then the formatted index name would be `logs-2022-02-18`. 
| `indexNumberOfReplicas` | int| false |1 | The number of replicas of the index. 
| `indexNumberOfShards` | int| false |1| The number of shards of the index. 
| `keyIgnore` | Boolean | false |true | Whether to ignore the record key to build the Elasticsearch document `_id`. If primaryFields is defined, the connector extract the primary fields from the payload to build the document `_id` If no primaryFields are provided, elasticsearch auto generates a random document `_id`. 
| `malformedDocAction` | enum (IGNORE,WARN,FAIL) | false | FAIL | How to handle elasticsearch rejected documents due to some malformation. Possible options are IGNORE, DELETE or FAIL. Default is FAIL the Elasticsearch document. 
| `maxRetries` | Integer | false | 1 | The maximum number of retries for elasticsearch requests. Use -1 to disable it.  
| `maxRetryTimeInSec` | Integer| false | 86400 | The maximum retry time interval in seconds for retrying an elasticsearch request. 
| `nullValueAction` | enum (IGNORE,DELETE,FAIL) | false | IGNORE | How to handle records with null values, possible options are IGNORE, DELETE or FAIL. Default is IGNORE the message. 
| `password` | String| false | " " (empty string)|The password used by the connector to connect to the elastic search cluster. <br /><br />If `username` is set, then `password` should also be provided.  
| `primaryFields` | String | false | "id" | The comma separated ordered list of field names used to build the Elasticsearch document `_id` from the record value. If this list is a singleton, the field is converted as a string. If this list has 2 or more fields, the generated `_id` is a string representation of a JSON array of the field values. 
| `retryBackoffInMs` | Integer | false | 100 | The base time to wait when retrying an Elasticsearch request (in milliseconds). 
| `schemaEnable` | Boolean | false | false | Turn on the Schema Aware mode. 
| `socketTimeoutInMs` | Integer | false |60000 | The socket timeout in milliseconds waiting to read the elasticsearch response. 
| `ssl` | ElasticSearchSslConfig | false | string | Configuration for TLS encrypted communication. See xref:io-elastic-sink.adoc#ssl-configuration[]. 
| `stripNonPrintableCharacters` | Boolean| false | true| Whether to remove all non-printable characters from the document or not. If it is set to true, all non-printable characters are removed from the document. 
| `stripNulls` | Boolean | false |true | If stripNulls is false, elasticsearch _source includes 'null' for empty fields (for example {"foo": null}), otherwise null fields are stripped. 
| `token` | String| false | " " (empty string)|The token used by the connector to connect to the ElasticSearch cluster. Only one between basic/token/apiKey authentication mode must be configured. 
| `typeName` | String | false | "_doc" | The type name to which the connector writes messages to. The value should be set explicitly to a valid type name other than "_doc" for Elasticsearch version before 6.2, and left to default otherwise. 
| `username` | String| false |" " (empty string)| The username used by the connector to connect to the elastic search cluster. If `username` is set, then `password` should also be provided.
