To create a SQLite sink connector for {product_name} topics:

. On the *Sinks* tab, select *Create Sink*.

. Enter the namespace, sink type, and sink name.
+

+
[NOTE]
====
Your sink name and index name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
It can only contain lowercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and hyphens.
====

. You can use the default settings, or expand *Advanced Settings* if you want more control of the sink connector.
+

+
[NOTE]
====
Disabling *Validate Connection* will skip checking the connection. Enabling *Force Create* will skip checking the connection, and will skip validating the configuration.
====

. Choose the sink topic. Messages published to the selected topic will be forwarded to the connected sink. For this example, we're using `topic-1`.

== Configure sink

. Complete the fields in *Sink-Specific Configuration*. Different sink connectors have different configuration fields. There are links and descriptions under each value if you're unsure where to find them in your deployment. Review the connector's configuration settings in the xref:connectors/sinks/astream-jdbc-sqlite-sink.adoc#configuration[configuration] for more information.
+
In this example, {product_name} doesn't have a config definition on file, so we'll be manually building our own `configs` with key-value pairs.
+
Example JSON and YAML configs for a JDBC SQLite sink connector are below:

JSON::

[source,json]
----
{
   "configs": {
      "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:sqlite:db.sqlite",
      "tableName": "pulsar_sqlite_jdbc_sink"
   }

YAML::

tenant: "public"
namespace: "default"
name: "jdbc-sqlite-sink"
inputs: [ "persistent://public/default/jdbc-sqlite-topic" ]
sinkType: "jdbc-sqlite"
configs:
    jdbcUrl: "jdbc:sqlite:db.sqlite"
    tableName: "pulsar_sqlite_jdbc_sink"

. Enter your config pairs into {product_name} to connect your sink to a SQLite database. In the example below, we're passing values to the `configs` of the sink connector.

For more on the JDBC SQLite sink connector configuration, see the xref:connectors/sinks/astream-jdbc-sqlite-sink.adoc#configuration[configuration].

. Click *Create*. Confirm you have created your new sink connector in the *Sinks* tab. You will see your SQLite sink listed under the *Consumers* tab.
