Processing Guarantee offers three options:

* *ATLEAST_ONCE*: Each message sent to the sink can be processed more than once.
* *ATMOST_ONCE*: The message sent to the sink is processed at most once. Therefore, there is a chance that the message is not processed.
* *EFFECTIVELY_ONCE*: Each message sent to the sink will have one output associated with it.
