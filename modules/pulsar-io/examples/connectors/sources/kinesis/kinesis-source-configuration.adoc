|*Description*

|`initialPositionInStream`|InitialPositionInStream|false|LATEST|The position where the connector starts from. Below are the available options: +
* `AT_TIMESTAMP`: start from the record at or after the specified timestamp. +
* `LATEST`: start after the most recent data record. +
* `TRIM_HORIZON`: start from the oldest available data record.
|`startAtTime`|Date|false|" " (empty string)|If set to `AT_TIMESTAMP`, it specifies the point in time to start consumption.
|`applicationName`|String|false|Pulsar IO connector|The name of the Amazon Kinesis application. +
By default, the application name is included in the user agent string used to make AWS requests. This can assist with troubleshooting, for example, distinguish requests made by separate connector instances.
|`checkpointInterval`|long|false|60000|The frequency of the Kinesis stream checkpoint in milliseconds.
|`backoffTime`|long|false|3000|The amount of time to delay between requests when the connector encounters a throttling exception from AWS Kinesis in milliseconds.
|`numRetries`|int|false|3|The number of re-attempts when the connector encounters an exception while trying to set a checkpoint.
|`receiveQueueSize`|int|false|1000|The maximum number of AWS records that can be buffered inside the connector. +
Once the `receiveQueueSize` is reached, the connector does not consume any messages from Kinesis until some messages in the queue are successfully consumed.
|`dynamoEndpoint`|String|false|" " (empty string)|The Dynamo end-point URL, which can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html[here].
|`cloudwatchEndpoint`|String|false|" " (empty string)|The Cloudwatch end-point URL, which can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html[here].
|`useEnhancedFanOut`|boolean|false|true|If set to true, it uses Kinesis enhanced fan-out. +If set to false, it uses polling.
|`awsEndpoint`|String|false|" " (empty string)|The Kinesis end-point URL, which can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html[here].
|`awsRegion`|String|false|" " (empty string)|The AWS region. **Example** `us-west-1`, `us-west-2`
|`awsKinesisStreamName`|String|true|" " (empty string)|The Kinesis stream name.
|`awsCredentialPluginParam`|String |false|" " (empty string)|The JSON parameter to initialize `awsCredentialsProviderPlugin`.
|`awsCredentialPluginName`|String|false|" " (empty string)|The fully-qualified class name of implementation of {@inject: github:AwsCredentialProviderPlugin:/pulsar-io/aws/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/io/aws/AwsCredentialProviderPlugin.java} +
`awsCredentialProviderPlugin` has the following built-in plugs: +
`org.apache.pulsar.io.kinesis.AwsDefaultProviderChainPlugin`: this plugin uses the default AWS provider chain. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default[using the default credential provider chain]. +
`org.apache.pulsar.io.kinesis.STSAssumeRoleProviderPlugin`: this plugin takes a configuration via the `awsCredentialPluginParam` that describes a role to assume when running the KCL. +
**JSON configuration example** +
`{"roleArn": "arn...", "roleSessionName": "name"}` +
`awsCredentialPluginName` is a factory class which creates an AWSCredentialsProvider that is used by Kinesis sink. +
If `awsCredentialPluginName` set to empty, the Kinesis sink creates a default AWSCredentialsProvider which accepts json-map of credentials in `awsCredentialPluginParam`.
