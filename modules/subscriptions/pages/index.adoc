= Subscriptions in Pulsar
:page-tag: pulsar-subscriptions,quickstart,admin,dev,pulsar

*Subscriptions* in Pulsar describe which consumers are consuming data from a topic and how they want to consume that data. +

Subscriptions are managed in the broker as a collection of metadata about a topic and its subscribed consumers. This metadata includes: 

* Topic name - which topic the consumer wants data from
* Subscription name - a string representing a qualified name for the subscription
* Subscription type - which type of subscription is being used
* Subscription cursor - a representation of the consumer's current place in the subscribed topic log 

For example, the Pulsar consumer below has a *shared* subscription starting at the *earliest* cursor position in `my-subscription` to `my-topic`:

[source,java]
----
pulsarConsumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.BYTES)
    .topic("my-topic")
    .subscriptionName("my-subscription")
    .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)
    .subscriptionInitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest)
    .subscribe();
----

Read on to use Pulsar's four types of subscriptions to manage your topic consumption.
