*Subscriptions* in {pulsar-reg} describe which consumers are consuming data from a topic and how they want to consume that data. +

If an xref:astream-subscriptions-exclusive.adoc[exclusive] consumer fails, the topic backlog balloons with stale, unacknowledged messages. {pulsar-short} solves this problem with *failover* subscriptions. +
In *failover* subscriptions, {pulsar-short} designates one *primary* consumer and multiple *standby* consumers. If the primary consumer disconnects, the standby consumers begin consuming the subsequent unacknowledged messages. +

This document explains how to use {pulsar-short}'s failover subscription model to manage your topic consumption.

== Failover subscription example

To try out a {pulsar-short} failover subscription, add `.subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Failover)` to the `pulsarConsumer` in `SimplePulsarConsumer.java`.

[source,java]
----
pulsarConsumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.JSON(DemoBean.class))
    .topic("persistent://"
        + conf.getTenantName() + "/"
        + conf.getNamespace() + "/"
        + conf.getTopicName())
    .startMessageIdInclusive()
    .subscriptionInitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest)
    .subscriptionName("SimplePulsarConsumer")
    .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Failover)
    .subscribe();
----

. Open `pulsar-subscription-example` in the IDE of your choice and run `SimplePulsarConsumer.java` to begin consuming messages. +
This is the *primary* consumer. +
The confirmation message and a cursor appear to indicate the consumer is ready.

. Open a new terminal window and run `SimplePulsarConsumer.java`. This is the *backup* consumer. The backup consumer subscribes to the topic, but does not immediately begin consuming messages.

. Return to the *primary* consumer and `Ctrl+C` to stop it. The *backup* consumer begins consuming right where the first consumer left off.
