*Subscriptions* in {pulsar-reg} describe which consumers are consuming data from a topic and how they want to consume that data. +

A *shared* subscription allows *multiple consumers* to consume messages from a *single topic* in round-robin fashion. +
More consumers in a shared subscription can increase your {pulsar-short} deployment's rate of message consumption, but at the cost of losing message ordering guarantees and acknowledgement schemes.

This document explains how to use {pulsar-short}'s shared subscription model to manage your topic consumption.

== Shared subscription example

To try out a {pulsar-short} shared subscription, add `.subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)` to the `pulsarConsumer` in `SimplePulsarConsumer.java`.

[source,java]
----
pulsarConsumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.JSON(DemoBean.class))
    .topic("persistent://"
        + conf.getTenantName() + "/"
        + conf.getNamespace() + "/"
        + conf.getTopicName())
    .startMessageIdInclusive()
    .subscriptionInitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest)
    .subscriptionName("SimplePulsarConsumer")
    .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)
    .subscribe();
----

. Open `pulsar-subscription-example` in the IDE of your choice and run `SimplePulsarConsumer.java` to begin consuming messages. +
The confirmation message and a cursor appear to indicate the consumer is ready.

. Open as many terminals as you'd like and run `SimplePulsarConsumer.java`. All the consumers subscribe to the topic and consume messages in a round-robin fashion. 

If you run this test with xref:astream-subscriptions-exclusive.adoc[exclusive subscriptions], you can't attach more than once subscriber to the exclusive topic.
Since this test uses shared subscriptions, you can attach multiple consumers to the topic.
