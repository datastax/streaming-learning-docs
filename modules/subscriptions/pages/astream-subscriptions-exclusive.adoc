= Exclusive subscriptions in {pulsar-reg}
:navtitle: Exclusive

*Subscriptions* in {pulsar-reg} describe which consumers are consuming data from a topic and how they want to consume that data. +

An *exclusive* subscription describes a basic publish-subscribe pattern where a *single consumer* subscribes to a *single topic* and consumes from it. +

This document explains how to use {pulsar-short}'s exclusive subscription model to manage your topic consumption.

== Exclusive subscription example

This example uses the `pulsarConsumer` object in `SimplePulsarConsumer.java` below. +

[source,java]
----
pulsarConsumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.JSON(DemoBean.class))
    .topic("persistent://"
            + conf.getTenantName() + "/"
            + conf.getNamespace() + "/"
            + conf.getTopicName())
    .startMessageIdInclusive()
    .subscriptionInitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest)
    .subscriptionName("SimplePulsarConsumer")
    .subscribe();
----

[NOTE]
====
{pulsar-short} creates an exclusive subscription by default when no `subscriptionType` is declared.
====

. Open the `pulsar-subscription-example` repo in the IDE of your choice and run `SimplePulsarConsumer.java` to begin consuming messages. +
The confirmation message and a cursor appear to indicate the consumer is ready.

The second consumer cannot subscribe to the topic because the subscription is *exclusive*. +

In the example above, the consumer didn't declare a subscription type, so {pulsar-short} created an exclusive subscription by default. +
To explicitly define an exclusive subscription, add `.subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Exclusive)` to the consumer.
